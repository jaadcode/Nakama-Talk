# Nakama-Talk

## Base idea

Create a one page website where it’s possible to talk to an AI like a real conversation like advanced voice chat with Chat GPT.
The AI should speak Japanese with the voice of Luffy (only him for the moment)
There should be subtitles and live conversation historic

## How to proceed

1. Speech-to-text (so the AI understands what the user says)
The best one seems to be **Whispers,** very strong for japanese
2. Conversational AI (to generate Luffy style responses)
Plug in an LLM like OpenRouter.ai
3. Text-to-speech (Turn Luffy’s response into audio)
RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)
4. Playback on Website
Audio object in HTML5, useRef and useEffect
5. Frontend
Simple page where you click a mic to speak and Luffy talks back
Use MediaRecorder API

## Here is an Organization plan by GPT

## **🧩 Step-by-Step Organization Plan**

---

### **1. 🎨 Design the UI (Frontend Only)**

**Goal:** Build a clean, minimal page to interact with Luffy.

**Pages & Components:**

- A mic button to **record**
- A chat window for **dialogue**
- Audio player to **listen to Luffy**
- Loading spinner, etc.

✅ Keep it simple, mobile-first.

---

### **2. 🎙️ Capture User Voice**

**Goal:** Record the user speaking Japanese.

**What to do:**

- Use MediaRecorder API to record audio in the browser.
- Send this audio file to the backend for transcription.

📤 → /api/transcribe

---

### **3. ✍️ Transcribe Voice → Text (Japanese)**

**Goal:** Turn spoken Japanese into text.

**What to do:**

- Use Whisper (local or via API) in /api/transcribe
- Return the Japanese text

---

### **4. 🧠 Generate Reply (LLM)**

**Goal:** Use the LLM (GPT-3.5 or Claude) to answer in Luffy’s style.

**What to do:**

- Send text to /api/chat
- Use system prompt = Luffy persona
- Return the Japanese reply

---

### **5. 🗣️ Generate Voice (Luffy style)**

**Goal:** Convert Japanese reply to Luffy-like voice.

**What to do:**

- Use a TTS service (Google TTS, VOICEVOX)
- Optionally run it through RVC for Luffy’s voice
- Return audio URL/path

📤 → /api/voice

---

### **6. 🔁 Play Response + Display Chat**

**Goal:** Update the UI with:

- Luffy’s message (text)
- Audio reply (playable)
- User’s message (text)

---

### **7. 🧪 Test, Polish, Deploy**

**Goal:** Run it like a real user would.

Checklist:

- Test on mobile and desktop
- Handle edge cases (no mic, bad input, long silence)
- Polish UI, animations
- Add loading states
- Deploy to **Vercel (free)**
